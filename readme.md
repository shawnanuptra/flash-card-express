# Flash Card App

This webapp is a simple Express app, with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The baseline functionalities should include:

1. See all available Flashcards
2. See all questions and answers of each Flashcard
3. Add a new Flashcard with 2 or more question-answer pairs
4. Start a _game_, where the app will prompt users for answers to questions
5. Give feedback to user - whether they answered correctly or not
6. Report how many answers were correct after every game

After these features are completed, feel free to extend the app! Here are some ideas:

1. Add data persistence to the app. Where will you store the data? How and where are you going to access the data in the app flow?
2. What if users want to keep playing when they answered all the questions for better recall practice?
3. What if users want to see and compare their previous attempt of using the Flashcard?
4. Make the Flashcard game more challenging by randomizing the order of the questions in the game.
5. Does your app have FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)? Research what it is and how to eliminate it.
6. Validate user input. What if the answer contains whitespace in the beginning or end?
7. Replace alerts with a custom modal for a more engaging and immersive user experience.

## Prerequisites

1. Have Node installed. Run `node -v` in your terminal to check if Node is installed in your system.
2. Have `git` installed. Run `git -v` in your terminal to check if `git` is installed in your system.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo with `git clone`.
2. Install all the required packages by running `npm install`. (Tip: you can just run `npm i` to save 6 keystrokes!! ^-^)
3. Open this project in `VSCode`, and install Live Server extension.
4. Run `npm run start`. This will run `nodemon server.js` in the terminal to start up the Express server (look at the "scripts" in `package.json`). `nodemon` restarts the server on every change in the directory (file save). This will eliminate the need to restart the Express server after every change.
5. Run the root `index.html` with Live Server by right-clicking the file, and selecting `Open with Live Server`. Similar to `nodemon`, Live Server just helps in development for enabling the _hot reload_ feature.

And you're all setup! The files are filled with comments such as `TODO:` as hints. These serve as guides to aid in your development. Have fun!
